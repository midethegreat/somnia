# ✅ Leaderboard Improvements - More Realistic & Reasonable

## What Changed:

### 1. **More Realistic Player Stats**
- Expanded from 5 to 10 players for better competition
- More balanced win/loss ratios (no one has 84% win rate anymore)
- Top player now has 75% win rate (much more realistic)
- Lower ranked players show negative profits (real betting scenario)

### 2. **Reasonable Profit Values**
**Before:** $15,420 profit (unrealistic)
**After:** +$4,250 SMN profit (reasonable)

- All values now use Somnia (SMN) currency
- Profits range from +$4,250 (top) to -$840 (bottom)
- Shows both winners and losers (more honest)

### 3. **Better Visual Indicators**
- Green (+) for positive profits
- Red (-) for negative profits
- Clear SMN currency labels
- Better formatted volume numbers

### 4. **More Realistic Win Rates**
**Rank 1:** 75% win rate (127W/43L) - Previously 84%
**Rank 5:** 43% win rate (64W/86L) - Previously 48%
**Rank 10:** 21% win rate (31W/119L) - Shows losing players

### 5. **Dynamic Description**
The subtitle now changes based on filter:
- "Top performers ranked by total profit"
- "Top performers ranked by total wins"
- "Top performers ranked by current win streak"

## Key Improvements:

✅ **10 players** instead of 5 (more competitive)
✅ **Realistic win rates** (21% - 75% range)
✅ **Both winners and losers** shown (ranks 8-10 are in red)
✅ **Proper currency** (SMN tokens, not just $)
✅ **More balanced stats** (no superhuman win rates)
✅ **Clear profit/loss indicators** (green/red colors)
